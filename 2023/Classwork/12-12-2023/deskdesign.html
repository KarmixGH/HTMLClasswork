                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                  I'vee often referred to It during interviews as an example of
